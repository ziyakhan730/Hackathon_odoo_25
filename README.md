**Project Description:**

This project is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend and Django (with Django REST Framework) for the backend. It features a secure authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage user sessions.

ðŸ”¹** Frontend:**
The React.js frontend offers a responsive and user-friendly interface. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs and handles routing using React Router. Key features include:

Login and registration forms

Protected routes accessible only to authenticated users

Token storage and automatic token refresh

Error handling and user feedback

**ðŸ”¹ Backend:**
The Django backend uses Django REST Framework (DRF) along with JWT authentication to secure the APIs. It provides:

Token-based authentication using JWT (access & refresh tokens)

Refresh token handling for seamless user experience

Middleware and permissions to restrict access to authenticated users only

API endpoints for login, registration, user details, and other resources

**ðŸ”¹ Database:**
The application uses SQLite3 as the default database provided by Django for development purposes. It stores all user data, authentication tokens, and other application-related information.

Tech Stack Summary:

Frontend: React.js (with React Router)

Backend: Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)

Authentication: JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens)

Database: SQLite3
